# Sensis
## A system that uses natural language processing to detect bias and emotional arguments made in articles online.
### Made at Disrupt the District 2018

Sensis is an attempt to make people more aware of the political lean and emotional content of articles online. Sensis takes articles that you visit and a scans them for emotional sentiment and political biases. It then returns the overall rating in bias to you in the form of a rating from 1-100, and then highlights parts of the article that helped Sensis come to its conclusion.
